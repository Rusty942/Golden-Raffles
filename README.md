# Golden-Raffles
This is a dynamic PHP website I created as a submission for my "Enterprise web systems" module in my final year at Robert Gordon University, it is built on a XAMP stack. The website allows users to create and run raffles that can be entered, the system is built using a MYSQL database that stores user login information, raffles and their entries.
